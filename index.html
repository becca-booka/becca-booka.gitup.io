    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <!--about me paragraph-->
    <p>Becca, she/her, 26, South African, and I currently live in Cape Town, South Africa with my family. 
        I am very new to the programming and tech world as I only began my studies in this field earlier
        this year (2023). I am a bit of a hisotry buff and I studied it in highschool and in university. 
        I am also really into art, especially drawing and watercolour, and I also love knitting and embroidery,
        and am learning how to crochet and would like to learn how to sew in the future. I also spend way 
        to much time online, scrolling through Twitter or Tumblr, and watching long-form youtube videos
        on a variety of subjects.
    </p>

    <!--Education heading-->
    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>I matriculated from Northcliff Highschool, Johannesburg, in 2015 with a distinction in Visual Arts,
        and began my studies towards a BA at the University of South Africa (UNISA) in 2017, majouring 
        in History and Anthropology,which involved a lot of reading and writing, finishing my studies in 2022.
        As you can see the direction I was going in was no where near the direction of the tech world,
        but at the beginning of 2023 I decided to make the change after watching my mom take part in the
        HyperionDev Software Engineering Bootcamp the year before. I had never thought I could become a programmer 
        or Software Engineer because I was always told that you needed to have very good maths marks in highschool to
        to even attempt to study towards those careers, and my maths marks where not very good. My mom showed me that 
        I could try it out on HyperionDev's free trial, and so I did, and I really enjoyed it! So I enrolled in their
        software engineer course in February 2023 and am currently on level 2 of the course. I am really enjoying myself
        and I am loving the challenges programming provides me, and I am looking forward to pursuing a career in this field!
    </p>
